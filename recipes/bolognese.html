    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This traditional Italian sauce is a family favorite. The fattiness of the beef and milk combines with the acidity of the tomatoes and earthiness of the vegetables to create a dish that is perfect for hot summer days or cozy winter evenings. The recipe can be easily doubled, tripled, or quadrupled, making it perfect for large gatherings - I have premade three portions to take on our 20-person family camping trips! Once you reach the simmer stage, low and slow is best. By the time it's done, your house will smell delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>   
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery</li>
        <li>2 carrots, sliced, diced, or slivered</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (substitute turkey if preferred)</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 15oz can tomatoes, whole or diced</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 lb tagliatelle (can substitute fettuccine, spaghetti, or rigatoni) </li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven or other large pan, heat garlic in oil over medium heat until simmering.</li>
        <li>Add onion, chopped, and cook until transluscent.</li>
        <li>Add celery, carrot, and bell pepper. Cook until slightly softened, about 2-3 minutes. Stir regularly.</li>
        <li>Add meat, pinch of salt, and a few twists of a pepper grinder. Stir the meat to break apart and cook until brown.</li>
        <li>Turn down heat. While pan cools slightly, warm milk in microwave or on stove until nearly boiling. This will prevent the milk from curdling.</li>
        <li>Add the milk. Adjust heat until it is just simmering. Simmer until the liquid has evaporated and milkfat has absorbed into beef (may take 15-20 minutes at low heat).</li>
        <li>Stir in the nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Add the wine, simmer in a similar fashion to the milk.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes & stir thoroughly. Turn stove down to the lightest simmer and leave for at least one hour, preferably three, ideally six or more.</li>
        <li>Serve over freshly cooked pasta with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
